# Notebook
The "VoiceAssistant.ipynb" contains the algorithm for bulding a voice assistant. This assistant takes input in the form of an audio from the user, converts it to text and peforms further processing needed to respond back to the user. Once it scrapes the result, it converts the text to audio and responds to the user in the form of audio.
